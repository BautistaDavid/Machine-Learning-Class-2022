# Machine Learning Class 2022
In this repository there are notes and projects made during my Machine Learning class for economists that I took from January to June 2022 at the Universidad Santo Tomas of Colombia. 

One of my projects is an APP made in Streamliner, take a look : https://share.streamlit.io/bautistadavid/machine-learning-class-2022/main/icfes_streamlit/app.py
